    <p class="about"> This amazing company was all created by me. Of course I had the help of others but it couldn't have been anything without me. I started this because I've always had an interest graphic design. The name Ordon comes from a nickname my friends always call me. I thought it was a great fitting for & Co. To know of the resources I use for my prints, please go to the Contact Me page and contact me!</p>
